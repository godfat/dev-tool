I am very tired of setting up tracking branch,
which needs two commands like this:

$ git config branch.master.remote github
$ git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master

This is very very annoying and hard to remember...
So I just wrote a simple script to do this:
http://github.com/godfat/dot-rc/blob/master/bin/git-track

Put this script under any path in $PATH,
in my case, it's ~/bin
then you can use:

$ git track

to do above. An example:

~/p/g/dot-rc master> git push
fatal: No destination configured to push to.

# because there's no tracking branch

~/p/g/dot-rc master> git track
git config branch.master.remote github
git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master

# default behaviour is tracking the only remote,
# if there's more remotes, e.g. github + heroku,
# this command would give an error like this:

~/p/g/dot-rc master> git track abc def
Which remote do you want to track?
Usage: git-track [remote]

# when there's a tracking branch, then push without arguments works:

~/p/g/dot-rc master> git push
